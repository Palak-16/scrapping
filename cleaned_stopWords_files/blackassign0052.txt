difference Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning , Statistics , Data Mining ? “ Data oil ” important trendline 21st century . reason advancements fields data analysis . field AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing staggering pace , fields popular buzzwords days . Buzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress . main reason misconception people . AI , ML , Stats , Data Mining , fields analysis data mistook thing , words interchangeably convey thing . true ! similarity disciplines disciplines analysis data converting data “ information ” . academics , learning AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining , academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored , case articles explain difference . , primary confusion learners . , article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitions . difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining ? essential difference disciplines lies “ aims ” approach achieve aims . aims fields explained detail sections : Artificial Intelligence : aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities . satisfy aim , understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent ? answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror ! ! Humans examples intelligent entities . , 1900s , researchers began exploring thought process , reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent . Mimicking human behavior aim AI initial years research . setting goal , studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test ! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks , sufficient fool interrogator . test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence . intelligence working human brain human brain , intelligence meaning ! , mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim . field Psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process . difference AI understand thought process mimic , build . collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks mimic function neurons present human brain . , basically , initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent . Concurrently , field computer science developing greater pace . advances computer science , experiments theories easily tested validated . programs applied solve real-life problems , found computers performed humans tasks complex humans . examples chess-playing program .

Machine Learning : problem-solving approach , big challenge AI overcome order achieve aim . solving math problem . cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach . math problems solve . problem familiar problem . problem . problem familiar , means solve kind problems solved similar problems past . , question , mind solve problem ? answer , solved similar problems past , learned past data , solve problems , haven ’ problem past , solve similar problems . form intelligence . case problem solved kind problems past . solve problem , consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion . kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process . kind intelligence . AI build intelligent agents , kinds intelligence developed agent . , reality AI reached point build agents learn past data find information . AI today reached point build agents . type intelligence . , AI implement type intelligence Machine Learning ! , domain AI focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning . reason ML called subset AI ! , main difference AI ML . Technically speaking , “ field study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions , patterns explicitly programmed ” . statement elaboration . essence ML process “ Generalization ” learning past data . Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims . humans recognize daily life objects . animal , easily recognize “ dog ” “ cat ” . trivial task wondered mind ? answer Generalization ! picture dog , easily recognize picture dog , , minds abstracted description dog formulated “ concept ” dog concepts learned past experiences dog . , dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds . generalization , real “ information ” . , give computers ability generalize “ raw data ” convert “ information ” patterns trends data . Statistics : discipline concerns collection , organization , analysis , interpretation , presentation data . Statistics deal data aim explain . , study explaining data ! Statistics main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics . Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data “ Descriptive ” statistics . explain information , easily large data complex task . Inferential statistics make accurate inferences small data . inference tasks daily lives . simple case cooking soup . completing recipe , taste small sample , , spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad . Depending result sample , make inference soup soup , good bad . Similarly , statistics , cases apply inference meaningful information . , case gather data time-consuming costly . cases , applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty . inferential statistics . , data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals . , , data , statistics explain data . aim resonate AI ML , statistics fields correctly interpret data ! Data Mining : “ Data ” , raw form . examples sensors industrial applications . sensors manufacturing plant sense properties temperature , pressure , . raw data generated sensors converted suitable form , processed , analyzed gather valuable insights , solve problem ! Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets , gather insights , Data Mining referred “ Knowledge Discovery ” . , Carly Fiorina , CEO Hewlett-Packard , “ goal turn data information information Insight ” . statement completely explains aim Data Mining ! , difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims . approaches fields , fulfilling aims fields . beauty fields !
